# Challenge Part II

## About 
This repository contains the second part of the challenge, the API tests. 

## Built With
- Java SE Development Kit 14
- TestNG 7.1.0
- REST Assured 4.3.0

## How to run 
Clone the source code or download the zip, and preferably run the tests inside any Java IDE with the IDE runner, however I would recommend Intellij since I've used it.
You can find all the test files inside <strong> src --> test --> java </strong> folder. You can run the tests separetely for each method or all att once by running the <strong> TestRunner.java </strong> class. <i> All of the dependencies are stored in the pom.xml file. </i>

## Test Reports
After each run you should be able to find test reports inside <strong> test-output --> index.html </strong> file. Currently the latest successful report that I had is uploaded.
